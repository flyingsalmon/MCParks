# This is a supplmentary page to Home_MC_Parks_Map.py app because it's under /pages/ subdir and is prefixed with "1_<scriptFile>.py" in that subdir
# which makes streamlit automatically add it as a page and its link on a sidebar menu from the main Home_MC_Parks_Map.py page.
# Its purpose is to allow getting directions to a selected park (from dropdown list).
# The dataframe is the same as in Home_MC_Parks_Map.py

# IMPORTANT: This script and image are in inside pages/ subdir but since it's made a page of the main Home_MC_Parks_Map.py page which is in the root directory we need to specify
# the pages/ path for the image from here!

# NOTE: Google Maps shows coordinates in Degrees, Minutes, Seconds (DMS) format, but our dataframe needs Decimal Degrees (DD).
# To get DD format from Google maps, locate in maps, right-click on the pin marker to see the DD values (drag mouse until next row in the popup to copy the coordinates text).
# Or better: right-click and Share...a popup window opens where the DD format is shown that can be highlighted and copied with ctrl-c
